# Pinterest Image Scraper
This Python script allows you to scrape images from a Pinterest-like website using the provided HTML file. The script utilizes the requests library to fetch the HTML content and BeautifulSoup for parsing the HTML and extracting image URLs. It then downloads these images into a specified output folder on your local machine.

The downloaded images will be saved in the downloaded_images folder. Make sure the folder exists; otherwise, it will be created automatically.

Notes
Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to download images from the provided URLs.
This script is specifically designed for Pinterest-like websites; modifying it for other websites may require adjustments in the code.
